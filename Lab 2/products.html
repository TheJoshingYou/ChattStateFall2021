                <p>Anasazi beans have stunning burgundy and cream-color speckles, and are the size and shape of a small pinto bean. Anasazi is the Navajo word for “the ancient ones,” cliff-dwelling Native Americans who lived in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona around 130 AD. Culinary legend has it that the beans were found in the 1900s in the ruins of their dwellings, but it’s more likely that they were continuously grown in the American Southwest, as they are today.</p>
